# Find Your Robot

This app was developed to learn the react fundamentals by following a tutorials.
This was one of my first projects so I had to mimic the tutorial, so that I could atleast learn some of the basics.

How this app works is:
*It displays a bunch of robots.

*If there is some robot that you want to find you can search it and as you search for its name the robots infront of you gets filtered according to your search.

*This happens until you have the robot you want.

I have some more part of this app that I have yet to understand, but for a starting project it was challenging and it helped gain some knowledge of dom manipulation in react as well as some front end using a library called tachyons.
